    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This Texas-style pulled pork recipe has a tangy barbeque sauce that's easy to make in the slow cooker. I like to serve the shredded pork on toasted buttered rolls. My family's favorite!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>This pulled pork recipe starts with a teaspoon of vegetable oil at the bottom of your slow cooker.</li> 
        <li>Pork: If your pork shoulder roast is larger or smaller than four pounds, you’ll need to adjust the ingredient rations and cook time.</li>  
        <Li>Sauces: You’ll need bottled barbecue sauce, yellow mustard, and Worcestershire sauce.</Li>
        <Li>Apple cider vinegar: Apple cider vinegar adds brightness and cuts through the other rich flavors.</Li> 
        <li>Broth: Use store-bought or homemade chicken broth.</li> 
        <li>Brown sugar: Light brown sugar lends warmth and sweetness.</li> 
        <li>Seasonings: This flavorful pork is seasoned with chili powder, garlic, and dried thyme.</li> 
        <li>Onion: A chopped onion gives the pork tons of flavor.</li> 
        <li>Buns and butter: You’ll need buttered hamburger buns if you plan to make pulled pork sandwiches.</li> 
        
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>

        <li>Pour oil into the slow cooker, then place the roast on top of the oil. </li>

        <li>Shred the pork and return it to the slow cooker to combine it with the juices.</li>
        <li>you’re making sandwiches, serve the pulled pork on buttered buns. </li>
